Movie Recommendation System
Welcome to the Movie Recommendation System repository! This is a project where we will be building a movie recommendation system using machine learning techniques.

Introduction
The goal of this project is to build a system that recommends movies to users based on their past movie preferences. The system will use machine learning algorithms to analyze user data and movie data to generate recommendations that are personalized to each user's taste.

Getting Started
To get started with the movie recommendation system, you will need to clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

git clone https://github.com/gomzee17-09/movie-recommendation-system.git
Once you have cloned the repository, you can start exploring the code and data files. The data for this project is contained in the data directory, and the code for the machine learning algorithms is contained in the src directory.

Overview
The movie recommendation system will be built using the following steps:

Data preprocessing: Clean and prepare the data for analysis.
Exploratory data analysis: Analyze the data to gain insights and identify patterns.
Feature engineering: Create new features from the existing data to improve the performance of the machine learning algorithms.
Model selection: Choose the best machine learning algorithm for the task of movie recommendation.
Model evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the model and fine-tune the hyperparameters to improve the results.
Deployment: Deploy the recommendation system to a web application or other platform for users to access.
Contributing
We welcome contributions to this project! If you're interested in contributing, please fork the repository and submit a pull request with your changes. We also welcome suggestions for new features or improvements to the system.
